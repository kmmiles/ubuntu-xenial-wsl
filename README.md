# ubuntu-xenial-wsl

## Install

Download the latest release zipfile, extract it and run `wsl-install.bat`.
Once Windows Terminal is restarted, you should see a new entry for the distribution.

## Modifying

Fork the repo, make any changes you want and push them. A test build will automatically kick off in the "Actions" tab.
When it looks good, click the "Releases" link on the right and "Draft a New Release". If the build is succesful, the zifile
will automatically be generated and attached to the release.
