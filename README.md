# ubuntu-xenial-wsl

## Install

Download the latest release zipfile, extract it and run `wsl-install.bat`.
Once Windows Terminal is restarted, you should see a new entry for the distribution.

## Modifying

Fork the repo and make any changes you want.
When you cut a new release on github, the zipfile will automatically be attached to it once the build is succesful.
